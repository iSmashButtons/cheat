## Basic 'if' form:

    if _conditional-expression_:
        # Code to run

-----
## Basic 'if' example:

```python    
if var > 3:
    print(var)
```
 
-----
## if/elif/else:

```python
if thing == otherThing:
    # code to run
    # goes here
elif thisThing > thatThing:
    # code to run
    # goes here
else:
    # code to run
    # goes here
```

`elif` and `else` are not required.
